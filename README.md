🌟 My Frontend Development Adventure

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my Frontend Development Repository, a place where I track my journey from a web dev newbie to a responsive design enthusiast. Every line of code, every branch, and every assignment here tells a story of learning, experimenting, and building under the mentorship of Mr. Deepak Prasad and Mr. Sahil Kumar.

🛤️ The Roadmap I Followed

Here’s how I explored the world of frontend development, step by step:

🌍 Getting Started: Web basics, 3-tier architecture, localhost, and ports

🧱 HTML Foundations: Headings, tables, images, and understanding the skeleton of a webpage

🧩 Block vs Inline: How elements behave and stack, plus layout tricks

🪟 Iframes & Media: Embedding videos, maps, and external content

🎨 CSS Styling: Selectors, backgrounds, margins, padding, positioning

🧭 Flexbox & Grid: Building layouts that adapt to any screen

📦 CSS Box Model: Borders, padding, content, and gradients magic

✨ Animations & Pseudo-Classes: Adding life to pages with hover effects and transitions

📱 Responsive Design: Mobile-first approach using Media Queries

💎 Bootstrap: Fast, clean, and modern UI components
